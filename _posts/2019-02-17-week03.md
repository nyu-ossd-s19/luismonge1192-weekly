My team extension project was Joannify and it was great to know that there are people helping you with the project. My team members are great to work with. They have a great sense of humor and understanding. We only worked together in class besides that we worked remotely on the project. The decisions of how to move forward with the project in class, we layed the basic outline of the project. We were communicating throught github pull request, issues, and comments. Overall, it was a good experience I just had a bit of trouble adjusting to the unstructured aspect of open source software.
