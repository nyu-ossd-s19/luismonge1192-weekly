The contributions I have made to my group project, Joannify, was the adding the license, rules of contributing, a bare bone mainfest, and an icon folder with one image so far.  

One thing I have learned for working on this project is the importance of communication with your community/group members. I believe that we will have an outline of our project by this Monday (2/11/19).  

One thing I learned from the github tutorial was the creation of a repo. I have always forked, clone, and created branches for an existing project but I now understand how repo are created and how to add contributors to the project.
