In my own words, the cathedral model of developing software has more structure, is between a singular memeber or small group, and no betas for testing. However, the bazaar model is more decentralized, more memebers involved, open to everyone, and massive amounts of testing. I much more prefer the bazaa model because there is more room to learn, for my stand point, and more places to be involved in.
