In my own words, the cathedral model of developing software has more structure, is between a singular memeber or small group, and no betas for testing. However, the bazaar model is more decentralized, more memebers involved, open to everyone, and massive amounts of testing. I much more prefer the bazaa model because there is more room to learn, for my stand point, and more places to be involved in.  

Two of the nineteen lessons that have caught my attentions is 1 Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch and 7 Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers. 1 means that anything of value always has something in common: that developers in that project are passionate about it. 7 means once you have a working verision realase it to the public and let the public test it out and hear what they say because they will always benefit the product.
