In terms of humanitarian open source software, I believe it is a good idea that will help many people in places where they cannot affoard similar proprietary software. However, with what I know with the licenses doing "good" can be arbitrary and open source software only tell people they call copy and alter the source code as they please, as long as they obey the terms such as provide the new source code, tell the user what they altered and give/do not give attribution to the orginal author.  

I think getting invloved in such projects would be nice because it shows that you care about your fellow humans and do it (for the most part) in your freetime without expecting to get rewared or get credit. Right now, I would love to get invloved in a HFOSS project, but it has to be something I am passionate about.
