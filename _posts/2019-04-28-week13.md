As of right now, my group and I have been working on documentation. So far it has been going well as my teammates pull request has been merged and I am slowly getting to that point. As of right now I have made more than seven additionally commits to the original pull request and slowly to it merged. My teammates have helped a ton and we plan to work on a single documenation or three seperate ones this week.
