The talk from Kevin Fleming was very informative. It showed me the progress of open source from its fierce opposition in the 1990's to where we are currently. A big and influential company like Bloomberg embracing and going full steam ahead on Open Source means that the future is in open source software. It seem like a better way of development, from how Kevin Fleming talked about it, compared to a closed circle way of development due to the fact that people will only get involved in a project if they are passionate or interested in. Likewise, the way companies are more "pushing" their employees get find open source software to replace their own proprietary software to improve thier own product. A complete 180 from the 1990's.


I have finally submitted a pull request to the project on the documentation. It was exiciting; however, it has not been merged yet so I gradually improving my pull request. As of right now I plan to work on more documentation with a new sense of how to apporach it and hopefully contribute some code this week or next week.
