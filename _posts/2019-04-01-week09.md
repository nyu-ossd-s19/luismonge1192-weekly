In my group project I have got a long way. I am using a Windows Operating Machine; however, I felt that it would be easier to do it on a Linux Machine, so I am using Ubuntu 18.04 to contiune the project. I have read the documention which states the architecture of the project. Additionally, we looked at the issues, as well as, the community guidelines.  

For Wikipedia, I always assumed that people who contribute to it were people who know a subject or trolls. I might be a regular contributor, but I must first get my feet wet, which this class is going to make me do. So, for the articles that I might contribute are going to be something I am fimilar like sports, videogames, and New York City.
