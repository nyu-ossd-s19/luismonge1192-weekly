This week guest speaker, Christos Bacharakis, was very interesting and open my eyes to the possibilites in open source. Before he came to the class, I was not aware of how free open source software is prominent in today's world. Due to his outwardly passion for the subject it got me more interesed in the subject and looking for projects I can be part of after this class.
