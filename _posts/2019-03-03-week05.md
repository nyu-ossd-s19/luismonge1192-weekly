This week guest speaker, Christos Bacharakis, was very interesting and open my eyes to the possibilites in open source. Before he came to the class, I was not aware of how free open source software is prominent in today's world. Due to his outwardly passion for the subject it got me more interesed in the subject and looking for projects I can be part of after this class.  


My project that I evaluated was CiviWiki and it currently has a GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. This means that anyone has the right to look, copy, and modified the existing code. Additonally, when one does modify the code, they have to clearly state what they modified and those modifiacation are under the same license. It also gives users the right to use it in commerical and private use. Lastly, anyone can distubute it, but must provide the source code as well.
